# Computational Math Assignments

This repository brings together the activities and implementations developed in the **Computational Mathematics** course, using the Octave language (compatible with MATLAB). The codes here apply classical numerical methods to solve computational mathematical problems.



## Content

Each activity is separated into `.m` files and includes a LaTeX report explaining how the algorithms work, hypotheses and examples. See the corresponding .tex file. Among the topics covered:
- Question 01:
    - ✅ Solving linear systems with Gauss-Jordan;
    - ✅ Iterative solution of non-linear systems.

- Question 02:
    - ✅ Using the Jacobian method to solve a system with two variables;
    - ✅ Gets the square root of a number iteratively.

- Question 03:
    - ✅ Constructs a clamped cubic spline interpolation with fixed derivatives at endpoints;
    - ✅ Ensures continuity of function, first and second derivatives across subintervals;
    - ✅ Plots the interpolated spline along with original data points.

- Question 04:
    - ✅ Implements numerical integration using Simpson’s 1/3 and 3/8 rules;
    - ✅ Compares absolute error against high-precision integrals for polynomial, trigonometric, and exponential functions;
    - ✅ Plots error convergence in semilog scale for each method and function.
