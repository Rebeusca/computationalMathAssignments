# Computational Math Assignments

This repository brings together the activities and implementations developed in the **Computational Mathematics** course, using the Octave language (compatible with MATLAB). The codes here apply classical numerical methods to solve computational mathematical problems.



## Content

Each activity is separated into `.m` files and includes a LaTeX report explaining how the algorithms work, hypotheses and examples. See the corresponding .tex file. Among the topics covered:
- Question 01:
    - ✅ Solving linear systems with Gauss-Jordan;
    - ✅ Iterative solution of non-linear systems.

- Question 02:
    - ✅ Using the Jacobian method to solve a system with two variables;
    - ✅ Gets the square root of a number iteratively.
